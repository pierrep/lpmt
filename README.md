# lpmt
Rewrite of the Little Projection Mapping Tool (hv-a.com/lpmt/)

This is a fork of LPMT meant to clean up the original codebase and keep the application alive.

## New Features:
* Improved slideshow functionality (including fades between slides)
* Added option to auto fit image to quads
* Added ability to colorize images as well as control hue/saturation/luminance 
* Fixed quad copying using CTRL-C and CTRL-V
* Added an option to draw outlines around masks in order to smooth the edges
* Added the ability for a surface to receive small images via OSC
